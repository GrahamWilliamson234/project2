# [My Project 2](http://project2.grahamwilliamson.ie)  General Knowledge Quiz

Hi! My name is Graham. In this README page were you will find out a little about me, my website, my coding journey, my projects and who has influenced me in the development of this website.

This is my second course project, by now I have gained a little experience but still very much a novice. Of the options for this project I thought a quiz would be fun with the challenging bit of writing good questions.

My code for this project was originally heavily influenced by The WebShala [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheWebShala) channel but this 2.0 version is a much more individual effort.

I hope you have fun.

# Design.

For this project I decided to do a quiz as I love a good pub quiz. Quiz's in general can be very enjoyable and hopefully I acheived that. The color scheme for this website is very much tied in with the background image, the chocolate colored font adding some warmth with the light grey adding a bit of contrast. The font used on this project is <u>Cinzel</u>, I choosed this font as I think it adds some sharpness to the overall look. My process of constructing this project was to source all images, including favicon, draw up a mock layout then begin with the HTML. To dress everything up, CSS was added and to make it all dance, Javascript provided all the glitz and glamour.

# Main Page.
The man page has a lovely background of the Trinity College Library, imaged sourced from Unsplash [Website](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/trinity-college).

To finish off the design of this website, I added a favicon of a cartoon brain as a sign of intellegence with a dash of fun.
